# DAS
Doctor Appointment System

# Description
The Doctor Appointment System (DAS) is a new system that will help patients schedule appointments with doctors. This system is a great alternative than the traditional method of calling the doctor's office to schedule an appointment, because like most business, you never know how busy the office is going to be and for how long you will be placed on hold for. With this Doctor Appointment System, patients will no longer have to risk being placed on hold for who knows how long because the schedualing is all done online. Once the schedualing is done, then the patient will be able to view their schedualed appointments.
